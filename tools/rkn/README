CONFIGURATION FILE
==================

rknr_get.pl accept as non option argument a configuration file name,

USING
=====

Edit rknr_get.sh and conf file to fit your configuration. This script
execute rknr_get.pl with needed options to download a register and
convert it, and after that send a signal to trfl to reload a config.

On every run rknr_get.pl checks last update time of urgent entries and
if it bigger than a last download time, a registry is downloaded.
Also, if last update time of urgent entries is not changed but
time elpased from a last registry download is bigger than
MAX_DOWNLOAD_INTERVAL(see rknr_get.pl), then a registry is downloaded.

As soon as needed changes are applied place a line in cron for
executing rknr_get.sh like this:

*/10 *  * * *  root  /opt/rkn/rknr_get.sh

Do not forget to add the line like the next to cron file too:

0 1  * * *  root  find /opt/rkn/backup/ -mtime +20 -type f -exec rm -f '{}' \+

To automatically delete old backup files.

To convert existent xml file without downloading it, use -i option.
